The American Monsoon System (AMS) is the main source of rainfall for the most part of Latin America and southwestern United States. 
Climate variability and teleconnections to this monsoon system can impact the population through changes in extreme precipitation, the timings of the monsoon or the overall rainfall during the rainy or the dry seasons. Changes to the rainfall can cause impacts on many scales from short-term floods to prolongued droughts.  

One key tool to understand the causes and mechanims for these changes to the monsoon are general circulation models (GCMs). These models are used to provide climate projections of future climate in the AMS. However, GCMs may also be used to understand physical mechanisms associated with climate variability and teleconnections. This understanding can not only improved predictability of the monsoon on various scales but can also push model development to better represent key processes.

\section{Motivation}

For many reasons, the American monsoons have been less studied than other monsoon regions, even sometimes not regarded as a proper monsoon. Key questions remain for the climate of the region. 
Assessments of GCMs for their representation of the climate of the AMS are scarce, and thus how much can be better understood about the AMS from these models is also unknown. 


 This thesis focuses on the American Monsoon System and the outstanding questions regarding the climate variablity and teleconnections affecting this monsoon.
 
\section{Contribution and aims}

 Chapter 3 evaluates two state-of-the-art CMIP6 models for their representation of the monsoon system. In general, the models show a good representation of the seasonal cycle as they are able to simulated detail aspects such as the Midsummer drought. ENSO teleconnections in these models appear to be non-linear, as are the observations. Chapter 4 provides a method that is able to better characterise the MSD timings and strenghths, as a way of analysing the mechanisms of the MSD in observations and models, analysis that is done in chapter 5. The Quasi-biennial Oscillation is proposed to be responsible for the different ENSO teleconnections shown in chapter 3 and are thus further explored using modelling experiments in chapter 6.

\@writefile{loc}{\contentsline {added}{Added: \truncate {\Changestruncatewidth }{In contrast, a relatively well-known aspect of tropical climate is the El Ni√±o-Southern Oscillation (ENSO), which is a coupled-ocean atmosphere phenomena in the Pacific Ocean that produces long-distance impacts throughout the planet \citep  {mcphaden2006}, and is therefore known as a prominent influence of interannual variability in the AMS regions \citep  {magana2003,vera2006,marengo2014climate}. Progress has been made in understanding the impacts and pathways of ENSO to South America \citep  {marengo2012,cai2020}, and current research has found that ENSO variability promotes different impacts to South America \citep  {hill2009south,tedeschi2015}. However, the interaction of ENSO teleconnections with other aspects of climate variability is still an active topic of research \citep  {cai2020,jimenez2021}.}}{3}{section*.8}\protected@file@percent }
\@writefile{loc}{\contentsline {added}{Added: \truncate {\Changestruncatewidth }{For instance, a growing number of studies have suggested a link between the stratosphere and the tropical troposphere, called stratospheric-tropospheric coupling \citep  {haynes2021influence}. This coupling is suggested to include tropospheric features such as ENSO and other modes of tropical variability \citep  {hitchman2021observational,martin2021nature}. There is no full description of the causes for these observed relationships yet, but if the stratosphere is found to be a relevant factor to modulate aspects of tropical convection, such as ENSO impacts, there would be an opportunity to better predict tropospheric variability because the equatorial stratosphere is generally predictable at longer time-scales than the troposphere. Stratospheric-tropospheric coupling will be another central topic of this thesis.}}{3}{section*.9}\protected@file@percent }
\@writefile{loc}{\contentsline {added}{Added: \truncate {\Changestruncatewidth }{ This thesis begins with an assessment of the mean state of the AMS in a state-of-the-art climate model in Chapter \ref  {ch:4-ams}. This chapter showcases how this model may be used to increase our knowledge of the AMS, by investigating the seasonality of monsoons and bimodal regimes using a new method in Chapter \ref  {ch:5-wvt} and the physical mechanisms for the seasonal cycle of southern Mexico in Chapter \ref  {ch:6-msd}. The first result chapter also shows suggestive evidence that the stratosphere may play a role in the tropical surface, which leads to Chapter \ref  {ch:7-qbo} which investigates whether there is any coupling between the stratosphere and the troposphere within a GCM. }}{4}{section*.10}\protected@file@percent }

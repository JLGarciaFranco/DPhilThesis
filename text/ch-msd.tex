\chapter{\label{ch:5-msd}On the physical mechanisms of the MSD of southern Mexico and Central America in the Met Office Unified Model}

%\minitoc

The physical mechanisms responsible for the seasonal cycle of precipitation of southern Mexico and Central America remain debated and with the prospect of greenhouse driven changes to the circulation and precipitation understanding these mechanisms will be key for adaptation. 
This chapter revisits the problem of understanding the physical mechanisms that give rise to the Midsummer drought by comparing reanalysis and observational datasets with a number of CMIP6 experiments from the Met Office Hadley Centre models: HadGEM3 and UKESM1. 
The roles of the East Pacific sea-surface temperatures and cloud radiative effects, as well as of the Caribbean Low-Level Jet are investigated. 
A thermodynamic diagnosis of the MSD is also performed via the analysis of the moist static energy budget and the surface entropy on both reanalysis and model data. 

\section{Introduction}

%The seasonal cycle of precipitation in Central America, Mexico and the Caribbean has shown robust signals of a bimodal regime of precipitation, termed \textit{the Midsummer drought} \citep{magana1999,perdigonmorales2018}. 
The a bimodal signal in the climatology of the seasonal cycle of precipitation has been documented in several regions of southern Mexico, Central America and the Caribbean and is most commonly referred to as Midsummer drought MSD \citep{mosino1966,magana1999,gamble2008,perdigon2018,zhao2020} but an accurate depiction of the physical mechanisms that give rise to this bimodal signal remains elusive. Studies disagree on several key aspects such as whether or no the bimodal signal of the Caribbean and Central America are connected or whether the two-peak structure is a result of two precipitation enhancing mehanisms or just one period of inhibited precipitation. Moreover, studies disagree on the the roles of local cloud-radiative feedbacks, thermodynamic and dynamic mechanisms associated with regional climate features that shape the precipitation spatial and temporal variability.


Section \ref{sq:litmsd} summarizes the literature that has aimed to explain the physical mechanisms through several hypothesis that propose different roles for the regional SSTs, wind flows and cloud radiative effects. The vast majority of studies are observational in nature and analyzed monthly-mean changes to the precipitation. 
Little-to-no attention has been given to this problem in general circulation models (GCMs) because most of them do not simulate the basic features of the seasonal cycle in this region. 
This chapter uses state-of-the-art GCM output part of the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project (CMIP) phase 6 to diagnose processes associated with the seasonal cycle of precipitation in southern Mexico and Central America. The Caribbean MSD is not directly addressed in this chapter.

\cite{ryu2014} shows that out of all the models in the CMIP3 and CMIP5 cohort only a handful of realizations show signs of a bimodal signal, with the Met Office Hadley Centre (HadGEM2) model being amongst the few that could simulate the MSD. 
 Chapters \ref{ch:4-ams} and 5 show that the CMIP6 MOHC simulations reproduce the timings and strength of the bimodal signal of precipitation with reasonable skill, albeit with a stronger first peak and a later onset of the MSD (MSDO). 
 The characterisation of the mechanisms that produce the bimodal signal in model data is therefore another avenue to understand the real-world MSD, one that has not been explored with great detail.
 
  Furthermore, the analysis of the characteristics of the MSD in a GCM, particularly of the simulated processes that cause the sub-seasonal variations of precipitation  as well as the differences between experiments with varying forcing and different horizontal resolution will also provide relevant information about the simulated current and future response to greenhouse forcing as well as highlight relevant biases in the region for model development. 

The previous chapter provides a useful diagnostic tool to separate the different stages of the MSD, a wavelet transform method (WT) that diagnoses the onset and end of the rainy season, as well as the start and end of the MSD. Similarly, the WT method can provide a robust measure of whether a given year and/or grid-point exhibits a robust bimodal signal. This chapter will use the WT method to separate the different stages of the MSD in model and observational data to better understand how the regional dynamics and thermodynamics varies from one stage of the seasonal cycle to the next. 

Most conceptual theories for the MSD involve elements of the regional climate of the Intra-Americas Sea (IAS) and the East Pacific Ocean, particularly, the Caribbean Low-Level Jet (CLLJ) and the East Pacific (EP) sea-surface temperatures (SSTs) are key elements of most theories \citep{gamble2008,herrera2015}.
This chapter first evaluates the seasonality and general representation of these elements in HadGEM3 and UKESM1. 
Then, several previous hypotheses are tested in the simulations and contrasted against the reanalysis/observations. 
The roles of the East Pacific SSTs, cloud-radiative feedbacks and the CLLJ are assessed within the frameworks of the mechanisms outlined in section \ref{sq:litmsd}. 


Convective quasi-equilibrium (CQE) and moist static energy (MSE) budgets have been succesfully implemented in monsoon regions to understand mechanisms that drive precipitation changes. The remaining section of this chapter uses MSE and CQE diagnostics to evaluate the role of thermodynamics and ascent within the moist column of the MSD for the seasonal changes to precipitation. 


\section{Data and methods}

\subsection{Observations and reanalysis data}

All the data used in this chapter is described in chapter \ref{ch:3-methods}. In particular, this chapter relies on the precipitation datasets of TRMM and CHIRPS, as well as the precipitation derived from ERA5. The rest of diagnostics are from ERA5 and unless otherwise specified the diagnostics were downloaded at the 0.75$^\circ$ resolution.

\subsection{CMIP6 data}

This chapter uses the output from the realizations of the HadGEM3 GC3.1 run at two resolutions at N96 and N216 and from UKESM1. These experiments described in section \ref{sq:cmip6exp}. This chapter follows the terminology and acronyms outlined in section \ref{sq:cmip6exp}. 

\subsection{Determination of the timings of the MSD}
Chapter 5 describes a wavelet transform (WT) method that can determine the timings of the MSD in observational gridded datasets, reanalysis and climate model precipitation time-series. 
This chapter will use throughout the WT method to determine the onset (MO) and retreat (MR) of the monsoon rainy season, as well as the onset of the MSD (MSDO) and end (MSDE). Similarly, the timings of the first (1P) and second (2P) peaks of precipitation are determined from the WT method. 

As a brief reminder of the method, MO and MR are determined by the maximum and minimum sum of WT coefficients computed from a dilation scale vector ranging from 24 to 54 pentads. After MO and MR are determined, a second WT is computed with dilation scales to 10 to 24 pentads and the minimum sum of the WT coefficients corresponds to the onset of the MSD and the maximum to the end of the MSD (MSDE). 

The main region of focus is defined by the regions where the previous chapter highlighted to exhibit robust signals of a bimodal regime, in particular southwestern Mexico and northwestern coast of Central America (depicted in Figure \ref{fig:model_pr}. The WT method was implemented on the TRMM, CHIRPS and ERA5 datasets and in the model output over the area-averaged precipitation time-series. 

\section{Climatological features}

The seasonal cycle of precipitation in the region of interest (Figure \ref{fig:msdcaribb}) is reasonably well simulated by several experiments of GC3, N216 and UKESM1.
The two-peak structure of the MSD is observed in TRMM and ERA5 as two precipitation maxima, the first peak found during early to mid-June and the second peak at the end of September, separated by a drier period that spans from late June to late August.  

The MSD in the experiments is observed generally one or two pentads after TRMM and ERA5 (see the mean values in the previous chapter) and shows a stronger variation of precipitation between the first peak and the Midsummer. 
In general, the pre-industrial control experiments show a higher magnitude of precipitation during the first peak and the MSD period whereas GC3-amip experiments are characterized by a very wet second peak.

\label{fig:msdcaribb}
\end{figure}



The spatial distribution of the rainfall anomalies associated with the variations of rainfall in the specified MSD region in the observations and reanalysis (Figure \ref{fig:eof2}) as well as in the simulations (Figure \ref{fig:model_pr}) shows that precipitation varies coherently across the region. 
Figure \ref{fig:model_pr}b for instance, shows that although the timings used to compute the composite difference between the MSD period and the MSDO period were taken from a precipitation time-series averaged over the study region, the precipitation differences spread south to the easternmost Pacific Ocean but also east to the Caribbean sea and into the northeastern Mexican states. This is also observed for the positive precipitation differences between the end of the MSD (MSDE) (Figure \ref{fig:model_pr}c, f, i) and the models seem to accurately reproduce these patterns. The precipitation differences associated with the MSD over the ocean in the models are notably larger than in the observations and reanalysis.

\end{figure} 


 The out-going longwave radiation (OLR) and vertical velocity ($\omega$ at 500 hPa) differences associated with the MSD (Figure \ref{fig:olranom}) also show that the MSD is not a local-scale feature but convective activity varies coherently in neighboring regions. From the MSDO to the MSD, OLR and $\omega$, increase notably in the easternmost Pacific, in southern Mexico and northern Central America and extend into the Caribbean islands and Sea; because $\omega$ is defined as $\omega=DP/Dt$  these positive anomalies are indicative of less deep convective activity and weaker convection. The OLR anomalies extend into the North Atlantic. 
 
 In contrast, a region several degrees west into the open Pacific Ocean (125$^\circ$W) and north of the study region into the North American monsoon region show signs of negative OLR and $\omega$ anomalies, in the MSD-MSDO panels, which are indication that simultaneously to the onset of the MSD,  convection is observed stronger and deeper in the North American Monsoon region and in the Pacific region west of the continent. The variations at around 125$^\circ$W where also found by \cite{herrera2015}. 
 
 The OLR and $\omega$ variations associated with the end of the MSD (MSDE) show a relatively opposite picture to the MSD-MSDO differences. OLR and $\omega$ decrease all across the central and south western coast of Mexico and northern Central America extending into the Caribbean Sea whereas positive differences are found in the North American Monsoon region and in the Pacific Ocean at around 125$^\circ$W.  


Precipitation in these regions depends on several factors such as the seasonal migration of the East Pacific (EP) and Atlantic ITCZs. The SSTs in the Gulf of Mexico, the Caribbean Sea, the western tropical Atlantic and the Eastern Pacific are also very relevant for the seasonal cycle and interannual variations \citep{magana1999,amador2008,straffon2019}. Figures \ref{fig:csst}a, b show the seasonal cycle of SSTs in the EP and the Caribbean Sea. While the EP shows a maximum in SSTs in late May, during the early stages of the monsoon in Central America, the Caribbean SSTs peak in early fall, about five months later. 


%The CLLJ is a strong easterly low-level (925 hPa) that reaches maximum winds speeds of 12 $m\,s^{-1}$ on February and July 
The Caribbean Low-level Jet (CLLJ)is a strong low-level easterly jet in the Caribbean Sea that peaks at the end of June (Figure \ref{fig:csst}e) at the 925 hPa level \citep{amador2008,herrera2015,maldonado2016}. The CLLJ  determines the moisture transport from the Caribbean Sea into the eastern Pacific across the Central American landmass as well as the northward moisture transport into the Gulf of Mexico and Florida \citep{munoz2008,hidalgo2015,maldonado2016}.


%Figure \ref{fig:eof1} shows the climatological summer rainfall in the region and the difference in rainfall between the first peak and MSD and between the second peak and the MSD, characterised by the MSD-MSDO and MSDE-MSD differences. 
%Although the dates of the onset and end of the MSD determined using the WT method are defined using precipitation area-averaged over a relatively small region, the precipitation anomalies associated with the different stages of the seasonal cycle extend to most of Mexico and the Caribbean Sea and Gulf of Mexico. 
%For example, consider the MSDE-MSD differences in the CHIRPS dataset (Figure \ref{fig:eof1}i) where most of northern Central America, southern Mexico, the eastern coast of Mexico shows a positive (+5 mm day$^{-1}$) anomaly. In other words a large region experiences a relatively large increase in rainfall after the midsummer.






Figure \ref{fig:eof2} shows the distribution of rainfall in the different stages of boreal summer in different CMIP6 experiments and ERA-5. 
The main feature, the East Pacific ITCZ shows the maximum rainfall rates (>15 mm day$^{-1}$ in the models) and strong mid-level ascent (-0.1 Pa s$^{-1}$). Prior to the MSD, rainfall extends from the easternmost Pacific ITCZ into the North American continent. Therefore, the positive bias during the first peak over land is associated with the biased wetter EP ITCZ.  However, during the MSD, rainfall decreases over land remaining only above 10 mm day$^{-1}$ south west of the coastline in the models.

\label{fig:csst}
\end{figure}


However, as shown in Figure \ref{fig:csst}a and as discussed for the radiative-convective feedback of \cite{magana1999}, SSTs do not increase in the East Pacific in the late summer and the second increase in incoming shortwave is only modest in the reanalysis (Figure \ref{fig:csst}d). 

 However, SSTs in the easternmost Pacific do not increase after, during or at the end of the MSD (Figure \ref{fig:csst}a). 
In fact, the SSTs decrease with the second increase in deep convection and precipitation. The other hypothesis of this theory, referring to the incoming shortwave is also not consistent with observations, as the incoming shortwave only modestly increases during the midsummer (Figure \ref{fig:csst}d). There is perhaps a role for this modest increase in incoming shortwave, but the link to SSTs suggested by this theory does not agree with the reanalysis. 


\section{On the role of the East Pacific SSTs}



Biases in the strength and position of the EP ITCZ in Global Coupled Models (GCMs) \citep{bellucci2010,li2014,schneider2014} are a major reason for biases in the model representation of rainfall in Central America  \citep{rauscher2008}. 

\cite{ryu2014} analyzed the performance of CMIP3 and CMIP5 models and found that the majority of CMIP5 models were unable to represent the total annual rainfall and the seasonal cycle of the MSD. \cite{ryu2014} also finds that models that simulate a bimodal distribution of rainfall, HadGEM2-A for example, also show an accurate seasonal cycle of the NASH and the CLLJ. However, an exhaustive analysis as to whether these features are actually driving mechanisms for the MSD in GCMs as in observations is missing from the literature. 


The CMIP6 Met Office models, HadGEM3 and UKESM1, are amongst the first models to simulate a bimodal regime in both Central America and Cuba (Figure \ref{fig:8}a and \ref{fig:msdcaribb}). 
In Central America and southern Mexico, the models simulate a wetter-than-observed first peak of precipitation and a drier MSD period.
% 
The so-called second peak of precipitation found in late August is simulated in close agreement with TRMM, except in the AMIP experiment which has a far too strong second peak mean precipitation rate.
% The seasonal cycle and other characteristics of the MSD showed noticeable differences between the different experiments analysed in this study. 

\section{On the role of the cloud-radiative feedbacks}

%\subsubsection{Climatological features of the MSD in UKESM1 and HadGEM3}
%Rainfall during the first peak has been too wet in these models since CMIP3, suggesting a persistent wet bias in this region associated with the East Pacific ITCZ \citep{ryu2014,mulcahy2018}. 




%For example, the Atlantic ITCZ biases have been shown to be directly affected by processes in the convective scheme \citep{bellucci2010}, such as the treatment of entraintment and moisture-cloud feedbacks \citep{oueslati2013,li2014}. 

The wetter EP ITCZ is a common feature of GCMs, including the Met Office models, which results from multiple biases in the radiative and convective schemes \citep{oueslati2013,li2014}. %For instance, the oversensitivity of convection to SSTs in models is a known problem with tropical climate modelling \citep{}.
% The entraintment parameter and cloud-radiative feedbacks have also been shown to play a role in these biases . 
 In UKESM1 and HadGEM3 several biases exist in the radiative balance in the easternmost Pacific Ocean. A positive bias in incoming shortwave in Central America of about 15\% and a cold SST bias in both East Pacific and Caribbean Sea SSTs are observed in Figure \ref{fig:csst}. Increased incoming shortwave but cooler SSTs require increased surface fluxes to maintain energy balance. These higher latent heat fluxes (LHFs) in the models in both basins (Figs. \ref{fig:csst}g, h) are almost 40\% larger than in ERA5 during the first peak of rainfall. The models also exhibit a larger seasonal cycle of the fluxes than the reanalysis. GC3 AMIP is the only simulation to also show a significantly positive bias in LHFs during the second peak of rainfall in the EP but also at the end of MSD in the Caribbean Sea. 


In all the model experiments, the ITCZ prior to the MSD period is stronger than in ERA5 by more than 5 mm day$^{-1}$, whereas after the MSD rainfall in the coupled models on the western coast of Central America agrees well the ERA5. 
This analysis suggests that the biases shown in Figure \ref{fig:7} are mostly coming from the period prior to the MSD. The models reasonably simulate the decrease in rainfall during the MSD (Figure \ref{fig:eof2}) followed by the second increase or peak. 
Note that GC3 AMIP, forced by very similar SSTs as ERA-5, simulated a much larger mean precipitation in the ITCZ during MSDE in contrast to the coupled models. This large positive bias in simulated rainfall in the East Pacific in GC3 AMIP corresponds to the larger than observed second peak observed in Figure \ref{fig:msdcaribb}a. 





 \begin{figure}[t!]
\includegraphics[width=\linewidth]{figures/modcompar_dif2u3}
\caption{As in Figure \ref{fig:msdolranom} but showing wind vectors at the 850 hPa level. }
\label{fig:msduanom}
\end{figure}


Composites prior to the onset of the MSD, during the MSD and after the MSDE were computed for several diagnostic variables. The periods were separated using the WT method to determine the dates of the MSDO and MSDE in ERA5 and the climate model output.
Figure \ref{fig:msdolranom} shows the composite differences between the period of the MSD and of the two peaks in out-going longwave radiation (OLR) and vertical velocity ($\omega-500$) at 500 hPa.
The positive OLR and $\omega$ anomalies in the MSD-MSDO panels in southern Mexico and northern Central America are indicative of decreased height of convection and decreased ascent, in agreement with the MSD being the drier period. These positive anomalies in the continent are accompanied by negative OLR and $\omega-500$ anomalies west of the continent, . 
%These anomalies are stronger in the simulations (e.g., Figure \ref{fig:msdolranom}c). 


The MSDE-MSD panels show the difference between the second peak of rainfall and the drier MSD period. Negative OLR and $\omega$ anomalies indicate stronger and higher convection over a wide region including the easternmost Pacific Ocean, southern Mexico, northern Central America Cuba and the Caribbean Sea.  
Note also the region of the North American Monsoon, on the northwest corner of Mexico and the southernmost US, as the MSD-MSDO difference suggests increased convective activity in the North American Monsoon region and 
MSDE-MSD the opposite. 

 \begin{figure}[t!]
\includegraphics[width=\linewidth]{figures/fig4_sstv_3}
\caption{As in Figure \ref{fig:msdolranom} but the anomalies are shown for SSTs [K] (contours) and incoming shortwave radiation [W m${-2}$] at the surface (line-contours). Incoming shortwave is defined such as negative differences imply less incoming shortave and positive anomalies represent more incoming shortwave at the surface. }
\label{fig:msdsstanom}
\end{figure}

Similarly, Figure \ref{fig:msduanom} shows the low-level wind field during the three stages of the MSD. In ERA-5, prior to the MSD the wind flow in the Caribbean shows strong easterlies that flow into the Gulf of Mexico and southeastern US but very weak winds in the EP (see Figure \ref{fig:csst}f). During the MSD, the winds in the EP become modestly strong eaterlies associated the easterly flow from the Caribbean Sea that crosses over Costa Rica and Nicaragua from the Caribbean Sea to the East Pacific. Note that the easterlies converge towards the region at 125$^\circ$W where OLR and $\omega$ anomalies suggest increased ascent. 

By the end of the MSD the easterlies in ERA5 weaken substantially on the western coast of Central America and in the Caribbean Sea.
The simulations seem to generally reproduce the characteristics of the wind field with some differences worth mentioning. For instance, prior to the onset of the MSD, all the simulations show a modest westerly wind flow in the east Pacific at 10$^\circ$N, which can also be seen in Figure \ref{fig:csst}f, which is not observed in ERA5.
After the MSD ends, most simulations show a very weak westerly flow in the East Pacific, close to ERA5; however, GC3 AMIP shows a modest westerly wind converging towards the west coast of Nicaragua. This low-level convergence may be forcing the increased convective activity and precipitation during this time in GC3 AMIP.

The SSTs and incoming shortwave radiation are key elements for explain the seasonal cycle of the MSD, according to previous theories summarised in section \ref{sq:lit}. 
Figure \ref{fig:msdsstanom} shows the corresponding SST and incoming shortwave anomalies during the different stages of the seasonal cycle. % MSD-MSDO and MSDE-MSD anomalies. 
From the first peak to the MSD, a positive SST difference of +1.5 K in the Gulf of California and the western coast of the Baja California Peninsula is observed in reanalysis and the models. The differences appear as a sharp SST meridional gradient pattern around 115$^\circ$W. 
During this stage, the incoming shortwave increases in Central America, which agrees with Figure \ref{fig:csst}d. 
Note the negative incoming shortwave differences west of Central America at 125$^\circ$W, the region of negative OLR and $\omega$-500 hPa anomalies where low-level winds converge, all of which supports the notion of increased convective activity that reduces incoming shortwave west of the continent. This feature was noted by \cite{herrera2015}. 

\subsection{On the role of the Caribbean Low-Level Jet}

 \begin{figure}[t!]
\includegraphics[width=\linewidth]{figures/modcompar_dif2mfc3}
\caption{As in Figure \ref{fig:msdolranom} but showing in shading, moisture flux divergence $\nabla \cdot \vec{u}q$ at the 850 hPa level with units of $10^{-7}$ s$^{-1}$ kg / kg and zonal wind anomalies (line contours) in m s$^{-1}$.  }
\label{fig:msdmfcanom}
\end{figure}

After the MSD, the western coast of the Baja California Peninsula continues to warm and the East Pacific continues to cool, in contrast to previous suggestions \citep{magana1999,magana2005,herrera2015}. Meanwhile, the Caribbean Sea warms by 1 K and the northern Gulf of Mexico slightly cools down. The incoming shortwave differences show a regional-scale decrease in incoming shortwave, as the summer draws to an end. 
These SST differences indicate that the meridional SST gradient in both the EP and Caribbean Sea and Gulf of Mexico is greatly modified during the stages of the MSD. 


The main dynamical argument put forth to explain the MSD is centred around variations in the moisture flux convergence (MFC), argued to be driven by the Caribbean-Low Level Jet \citep[see e.g.][]{gamble2008,herrera2015,martinez2019}. The MFC and zonal wind variations in each stage of the MSD is shown in Figure \ref{fig:msdmfcanom} for ERA-5 and two simulations. The low-level MFC increases from monsoon onset (MO) to the first peak period (MSDO) in the EP. This anomaly in MFC corresponds to a region of positive zonal wind anomalies indicative of weaker easterly flow.
 This zonal wind anomaly from MSD to MSDO is much stronger in the models.  
The MSD-MSDO difference shows a strong positive MFC anomaly across southern Mexico and most of Central America. 

In turn, the MFC anomalies associated with the end of the drier period, observed as the MSDE-MSD anomalies,  show negative values, suggesting increased moisture flux, over southern Mexico and northern Central America.
Increased moisture flux during the transition from the MSD to the second peak agrees well with the precipitation differences during these periods.  The MSDE-MSD zonal wind anomalies in the EP show positive zonal wind anomalies, suggesting a weakened easterly wind flow (see also Fig. \ref{fig:msduanom}). 

The MSD in Central America and southern Mexico has been strongly linked to the strengthening of the CLLJ \citep{herrera2015}. The maximum zonal wind observed in the CLLJ is found at the very end of July (Fig. \ref{fig:csst}e), synchronized with the start of the MSD. 
The zonal wind anomalies in the MSD-MSDO panels in Figure \ref{fig:msdmfcanom} show that easterlies in the Caribbean Sea do not strengthen by more than 2 m s$^{-1}$ from the first peak to the MSD. Only in the models is there a modest negative anomaly at the westernmost Caribbean Sea. In other words, while the peak of the climatological CLLJ coincides with the climatological timing of the onset of the MSD, these composite analyses constructed by more specifically separating the MSD periods does not show relevant variations in the zonal wind of the Caribbean Sea. 
The drier MSD period does coincide with stronger easterly flow over the eastern Pacific, which may be associated with the weaker MFC over land. %The end of the MSD then coincides when the easterly winds weaken.

The midsummer drought  is a  prominent feature of the seasonal cycle of rainfall of southern Mexico, northern Central America and the Caribbean. The average 20\%  decrease during the midsummer compared to the wetter periods of early and late summer is a rare feature of monsoon regions that has important implications for agriculture and water management  \citep{hellin2017,de2018,harvey2018}. 

Climate predictions of the MSD, particularly those concerning whether this "drought" will become more pronounced in the following years, are not trustworthy because of several reasons. 
One factor is the current limitation in the understanding of the physical processes that cause the MSD (section \ref{sq:lit}) as debate still exists over which large or regional-scale processes are most important to explain the increases and decreases of precipitation over intraseasonal time-scales.
Secondly, methods used to diagnose the timing and strength of the MSD typically deal with monthly-scale metrics, which would obscure subtle trends and processes that have an effect on shorter time-scales. 
Also relevant is the fact that climate models used to produce the predictions show significant biases in the EP ITCZ and the seasonal cycle of rainfall in the region, in fact, most CMIP3 and CMIP5 models did not show a bimodal signature in the seasonal cycle. Models that do not have a climatological MSD cannot provide a prediction for this regime in future climate. 

For these reasons, this section analysed the CMIP6 simulations from the Met Office models, UKESM1 and HadGEM3, aiming to understand the causes of the biases in the seasonal cycle. Furthermore, these models are better compared to CMIP3 and CMIP5 cohorts since UKESM1 and HadGEM3 actually simulate a bimodal precipitation regime in these regions. 
The purpose of this investigation is to use these climate models to better diagnose the relevant biases for the representation of the MSD but also understand the processes that these models are capturing leading to the MSD, in order to, hopefully, also highlight the dynamics of the MSD in general. 
%Therefore,this section and future thesis chapter evaluates the similarities and differences between reanalysis and model experiments. 
% For varios reasons, determining the timing and strength of the MSD is very important to agricultural practices,  and water management planning. 





%The different experiments showed notable differences in the precipitation amount in the MSD seasonal cycle.  The first peak, however, appears to be modestly related  to the precipitation amount during the MSD in the models and in observations ($r=0.6$) suggesting that the wetter the first peak the wetter the MSD period.  


 The wavelet transform method was developed to determine the pentads of onset and end of the MSD.  For instance, Figures \ref{fig:scatter}a,b show the scatter of the mean precipitation during the first peak against second peak and first peak against MSD in all the simulations and ERA5. The magnitude of the first and second peaks appear to be unrelated in these models and in observations, which would suggest that the processes driving each peak are not exactly the same.
 Similarly, composite analysis of various diagnostics during the different stages of the seasonal cycle was done, for instance,  OLR composites showed that the MSD is not a local feature in a small region of southern Mexico but extends throughout a wide range of North America,  from central Mexico through Belize, Guatemala, El Salvador, Honduras, Nicaragua, and northern Costa Rica. % Although the MSD has been documented in all these regions \citep{magana1999,perdigon2018}, these composites showed a synchronicity in the precipitation anomalies and a larger extent to the western Mexican coastline that were not previously shown, to our knowledge. OLR anomalies between the second peak and the MSD also showed a simultaneous increased convective activity in the Caribbean. 
 
 This composite approach also allowed to test previously proposed hypotheses by analysing the differences between model experiments and the observed variability in the characteristics of the precipitation at each stage of the MSD.
 For example, \cite{magana1999} proposed a mechanism that explains the MSD through SST-cloud feedbacks. In this hypothesis, shortwave, SSTs and precipitation are strongly coupled in the EP Ocean. The first peak of precipitation in southern Mexico and Central America would then be associated with the EP SSTs prior to the onset of rainfall. 
 Figure \ref{fig:scatter}c shows that EP SSTs prior to onset do not explain the inter-model differences in the magnitude of the first peak nor do they show a strong relationship in the observed interannual variability of the first peak mean precipitation. 
 Similarly, Figure \ref{fig:scatter}d shows that surface incoming shortwave variations are only weakly related to SSTs variations in the EP, in both models and reanalysis, during the first peak period. 
 
The feedback mechanism also suggests that the second peak is a result of a second increase in surface incoming shortwave that occurs as cloud cover decreases during the drier MSD. This increase in incoming shortwave then increases EP SSTs and thus increasing convective activity. Although the incoming shortwave does show a bimodal behaviour (Figure \ref{fig:csst}d), the SSTs in the East Pacific do not increase during the MSD period, but in fact cool during the end of the MSD.   Furthermore, as in Figure \ref{fig:scatter}d, variations in incoming shortwave were not strongly related to SST changes in any of the stages of the MSD (not shown). This suggests that the SSTs are not only dependent on the incoming shortwave in both models and reanalysis.

The low-level winds (Figure \ref{fig:msduanom}) show notable changes between the onset of the MSD (MSDO), the MSD and the end of the MSD (MSDE).
  Weak westerlies in the EP are found during the wetter periods but the zonal wind becomes a modest easterly flow during the drier MSD period. 
  The MSDO appears to be synchronized with the strengthening of the Caribbean Low-Level Jet (Fig. \ref{fig:csst}e). During the MSD, the strong zonal flow in the Caribbean crosses Central America into the central-eastern Pacific. This easterly flow during the MSD converges to 125$^\circ$W in the EP Ocean, a region that also shows increased ascent during the MSD. 
 % The zonal wind the East Pacific seems to be modulated by the wind in the Caribbean Sea, i.e., by the Caribbean Low-Level Jet strength.
 
Figure \ref{fig:scatter}e, f show the relationships between the zonal flow in the EP Ocean and precipitation in southern Mexico and Central America. 
The changes in the wind flow between the first and the MSD are not related to the drying response over land during the same period. 
However, the differences between the second peak and the MSD in the wind flow and precipitation show a strong relationship both in observed interannual variability as well as in the model spread. Simulations with a stronger EP zonal wind anomaly show the strongest increment in precipitation over land.
The zonal wind change in the EP from the MSD to the second peak period is also modestly related to the MFC over the continent (Fig. \ref{fig:scatter}g) with weaker easterly winds in the EP associated with more convergence over land in the models and reanalysis. 


%is associated with the variability observed in the precipitation changes from the MSD to the second peak, as well as with the MFC in the MSD region.  
The easterly flow in the EP has been associated with the strength of the CLLJ \citep{herrera2015}. The zonal wind changes in the MSDE-MSD difference in the EP shows a modest linear relationship with the zonal flow in the Caribbean Sea (Fig. \ref{fig:scatter}h). During the other periods, the relationship between the CLLJ and the EP zonal component of the wind is even weaker in both models and observations (not shown). 

%However, the zonal wind in the Caribbean Sea is not linearly related to MFC in the MSD region (panel g). In other words, it appears the CLLJ influences the EP zonal flow but not the MFC or precipitation in the MSD directly. 
 
A potentially relevant bias found in the models was stronger-than-observed surface latent heat fluxes (LHF) (Figure \ref{fig:csst}g, h) compared to the reanalysis.  Changes in the surface energy balance and the surface temperature in historical versus pre industrial control simulations may also be responsible for the precipitation differences between these experiments.  However, the variations in the LHFs, both MSD-MSDO and MSDE-MSD either in the Caribbean Sea or over land (Figure \ref{fig:scatter}i,j) are not related to precipitation over land.



The main factor associated with the precipitation variations in the seasonal cycle appears to be the low-level moisture flux convergence (MFC) (Figure \ref{fig:scatter}k, l). The variations in the MFC over land explain intermodel differences and observed interannual variability in precipitation, particularly in the positive rainfall increment from the MSD to the second peak. From the first peak to the MSD, moisture flux decreases and increases again from the MSD to the second peak. % The lowest decrease Stronger moisture flux into region leads to

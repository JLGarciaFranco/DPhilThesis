This thesis would not exist without the support of my family, my supervisors and my friends. 
Lesley Gray and Scott Osprey offered me their help, guidance and kindness even before my application process even started. I am incredibly grateful that I was able to be part of their group and that I was able to learn from them.
To Robin Chadwick, for always being willing to help me and provide very helpful advice.

To my parents, Virginia and Jorge, that have always encouraged me and supported all along the way, all together. Thank you. 
Things would be very different without me crossing paths with all the Ambiguos: Karen, Pablo, Diego, Ad√°n, Alinne, Montse, Carolina, Marcos and Dieguito. For always welcoming me back home. 
Special thanks to Karen Solorzano and Pablo Bonilla for supporting me at a long distance throughout the difficult times any thesis entails. 
To everyone in Mexico and Leeds that helped me get here: Michel, Angel, Juliane, Paloma, Marcos, Melissa and Veronica. 
 I also wish to thank all the great friends I made in Oxford: Kate, Aaron, RJ, Oscar, Hank, Filippo, Matt and Emily. 

My gratitude goes to the Richard's family, which supported my studies at Oxford through the Oxford-Richards scholarship at Wadham College. Acknowledgements to Wadham College and Dr. Hanna Christensen for all their support and advice.

abstract = {Abstract The quasi-biennial oscillation (QBO) of the equatorial zonal wind leads to zonally symmetric temperature variations in the stratosphere that descend downward. Here we investigate the QBO-induced temperature anomalies in the tropical tropopause layer (TTL) and detect pronounced longitudinal variations of the signal. In addition, the QBO temperature anomalies show a strong seasonal variability. The magnitude of these seasonal and longitudinal QBO variations is comparable to the magnitude of the well-known zonal mean QBO signal in the TTL. At the cold point tropopause, the strongest QBO variations of around ±1.6 K are found over regions of active convection such as the West Pacific and Africa during boreal winter. The weakest QBO variations of ±0.25 K are detected over the East Pacific during boreal summer, while the zonal mean signal ranges around ±0.7 K. The longitudinal variations are associated with enhanced convective activity that occurs during QBO cold phases and locally enhances the cold anomalies.},

TMPA is available both after and in real time, based on calibration by the TRMM Combined Instrument and TRMM Microwave Imager precipitation products, respectively. Only the after-real-time product incorporates gauge data at the present. The dataset covers the latitude band 50°N–S for the period from 1998 to the delayed present. Early validation results are as follows: the TMPA provides reasonable performance at monthly scales, although it is shown to have precipitation rate–dependent low bias due to lack of sensitivity to low precipitation rates over ocean in one of the input products [based on Advanced Microwave Sounding Unit-B (AMSU-B)]. At finer scales the TMPA is successful at approximately reproducing the surface observation–based histogram of precipitation, as well as reasonably detecting large daily events. The TMPA, however, has lower skill in correctly specifying moderate and light event amounts on short time intervals, in common with other finescale estimators. Examples are provided of a flood event and diurnal cycle determination.}",

Policy responses can compensate for failures of production-based entitlement (free or subsidized input distribution); labor-based entitlement (public works programs or “employment-based safety nets”); trade-based entitlement (grain reserve management or food pricing policies); and transfer-based entitlement (food aid or cash transfers).},

abstract = {Abstract Observational analysis has indicated a strong connection between the stratospheric quasi-biennial oscillation (QBO) and tropospheric Madden-Julian oscillation (MJO), with MJO activity being stronger during the easterly phase than the westerly phase of the QBO. We assess the representation of this QBO-MJO connection in 30 models participating in the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project 6. While some models reasonably simulate the QBO during boreal winter, none of them capture a difference in MJO activity between easterly and westerly QBO that is larger than that which would be expected from the random sampling of internal variability. The weak signal of the simulated QBO-MJO connection may be due to the weaker amplitude of the QBO than observed, especially between 100 to 50 hPa. This weaker amplitude in the models is seen both in the QBO-related zonal wind and temperature, the latter of which is thought to be critical for destabilizing tropical convection.},

abstract = {Abstract The quasi-biennial oscillation (QBO) of the zonal mean zonal wind is the primary mode of variability in the tropical lower stratosphere. The QBO is characterized by alternating easterly westerly shear layers that descend down from ∼10 to 100 hPa. The QBO is also seen in lower stratospheric tropical temperature, water vapor, and ozone and affects tropospheric variability through various teleconnections. We examine here the progress in simulating the QBO in the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project (CMIP) models, more specifically in CMIP3, CMIP5, and CMIP6 models. We show that the number of models that are able to simulate the QBO has increased from 0 in CMIP3, to 5 in CMIP5, to 15 in CMIP6. While the number of models with an internally generated QBO has tripled from CMIP5 to CMIP6, the fidelity of the simulation averaged over the CMIP models has not improved. We show that CMIP5 and CMIP6 models represent the QBO period and latitudinal extent quite well; however the QBO amplitude is shifted upwards relative to observations resulting in large underestimation of QBO amplitude at all levels below 20 hPa. The underestimation of QBO amplitude in the lowermost stratosphere and lack of variations downward to the tropopause and below will likely impact the quality of teleconnections seen in the current generation Earth system models.},

    abstract = "{This study examines the relationship between the Madden–Julian oscillation (MJO) and the stratospheric quasi-biennial oscillation (QBO) in a limited-area cloud-resolving model with parameterized large-scale dynamics. The model is used to simulate two consecutive MJO events that occurred during the late fall and early winter of 2011. To test the influence of the QBO on the simulated MJO events, various QBO states are imposed via the addition of characteristic wind and temperature anomalies. In experiments with only QBO temperature anomalies imposed (without corresponding zonal wind anomalies) the strength of convection during MJO active phases is amplified for the QBO easterly phase [an anomalously cold tropical tropopause layer (TTL)] compared to the westerly QBO phase (a warm TTL), as measured by outgoing longwave radiation, cloud fraction, and large-scale ascent. This response is qualitatively consistent with the observed MJO–QBO relationship. The response of precipitation is weaker, and is less consistent across variations in the simulation configuration. Experiments with only imposed QBO wind anomalies (without corresponding temperature anomalies) show much weaker effects altogether than those with imposed temperature anomalies, suggesting that TTL temperature anomalies are a key pathway through which the QBO can modulate the MJO. Sensitivity tests indicate that the QBO influence on MJO convection depends on both the amplitude and the height of the QBO temperature anomaly: lower-altitude and larger-amplitude temperature anomalies have more pronounced effects on MJO convection.}",

abstract = {AbstractIn the tropics, understanding the shallow-to-deep transition and organization of convection on the mesoscale is made difficult due the paucity of long-term high spatial/temporal resolution data. In this paper, data from the world's first long-term equatorial Global Navigational Satellite System meteorological station in Manaus (Central Amazon) is used to create a new metric, a water vapor convergence time scale, to characterize the temporal evolution of deep convection over a tropical continental region. From 3.5 years of data, 320 convective events were analyzed using a compositing analysis. Results reveal two characteristic time scales of water vapor convergence; an 8 h time scale of weak convergence and 4 h timescale of intense water vapor convergence associated with the shallow-to-deep convection transition. The 4 h shallow-to-deep transition time scale is particularly robust, regardless of convective intensity, seasonality, or nocturnal versus daytime convection. This new result provides a useful metric for both high resolution and global climate models to replicate.},

We employ a new framework for evaluating the rainfall regime of tropical forests and from this deduce precipitation-based boundaries for current forest viability. We then examine climate simulations by 19 global climate models (GCMs) in this context and find that most tend to underestimate current rainfall. GCMs also vary greatly in their projections of future climate change in Amazonia. We attempt to take into account the differences between GCM-simulated and observed rainfall regimes in the 20th century. Our analysis suggests that dry-season water stress is likely to increase in E. Amazonia over the 21st century, but the region tends toward a climate more appropriate to seasonal forest than to savanna. These seasonal forests may be resilient to seasonal drought but are likely to face intensified water stress caused by higher temperatures and to be vulnerable to fires, which are at present naturally rare in much of Amazonia. The spread of fire ignition associated with advancing deforestation, logging, and fragmentation may act as nucleation points that trigger the transition of these seasonal forests into fire-dominated, low biomass forests. Conversely, deliberate limitation of deforestation and fire may be an effective intervention to maintain Amazonian forest resilience in the face of imposed 21st-century climate change. Such intervention may be enough to navigate E. Amazonia away from a possible {\textquotedblleft}tipping point,{\textquotedblright} beyond which extensive rainforest would become unsustainable.{\textcopyright} 2009 by The National Academy of Sciences of the USA},

This study compares several statistical properties of daily gridded precipitation from different data (1998–2008): 1) Physical Sciences Division (PSD), Earth System Research Laboratory [1.0° and 2.5° latitude (lat)/longitude (lon)]; 2) Global Precipitation Climatology Project (GPCP; 1° lat/lon); 3) Climate Prediction Center (CPC) unified gauge (CPC-uni) (0.5° lat/lon); 4) NCEP Climate Forecast System Reanalysis (CFSR) (0.5° lat/lon); 5) NASA Modern-Era Retrospective Analysis for Research and Applications (MERRA) reanalysis (0.5° lat/0.3° lon); and 6) Tropical Rainfall Measuring Mission (TRMM) 3B42 V6 data (0.25° lat/lon). The same statistical analyses are applied to data in 1) a common 2.5° lat/lon grid and 2) in the original resolutions of the datasets.All datasets consistently represent the large-scale patterns of the SAMS. The onset, demise, and duration of SAMS are consistent among PSD, GPCP, CPC-uni, and TRMM datasets, whereas CFSR and MERRA seem to have problems in capturing the correct timing of SAMS. Spectral analyses show that intraseasonal variance is somewhat similar in the six datasets. Moreover, differences in spatial patterns of mean precipitation are small among PSD, GPCP, CPC-uni, and TRMM data, while some discrepancies are found in CFSR and MERRA relative to the other datasets. Fitting of gamma frequency distributions to daily precipitation shows differences in the parameters that characterize the shape, scale, and tails of the frequency distributions. This suggests that significant uncertainties exist in the characterization of extreme precipitation, an issue that is highly important in the context of climate variability and change in South America. }

abstract = {Abstract We document the development of the first version of the United Kingdom Earth System Model UKESM1. The model represents a major advance on its predecessor HadGEM2-ES, with enhancements to all component models and new feedback mechanisms. These include: a new core physical model with a well-resolved stratosphere; terrestrial biogeochemistry with coupled carbon and nitrogen cycles and enhanced land management; tropospheric-stratospheric chemistry allowing the holistic simulation of radiative forcing from ozone, methane and nitrous oxide; two-moment, five-species, modal aerosol; and ocean biogeochemistry with two-way coupling to the carbon cycle and atmospheric aerosols. The complexity of coupling between the ocean, land and atmosphere physical climate and biogeochemical cycles in UKESM1 is unprecedented for an Earth system model. We describe in detail the process by which the coupled model was developed and tuned to achieve acceptable performance in key physical and Earth system quantities, and discuss the challenges involved in mitigating biases in a model with complex connections between its components. Overall the model performs well, with a stable pre-industrial state, and good agreement with observations in the latter period of its historical simulations. However, global mean surface temperature exhibits stronger-than-observed cooling from 1950 to 1970, followed by rapid warming from 1980 to 2014. Metrics from idealised simulations show a high climate sensitivity relative to previous generations of models: equilibrium climate sensitivity (ECS) is 5.4 K, transient climate response (TCR) ranges from 2.68 K to 2.85 K, and transient climate response to cumulative emissions (TCRE) is 2.49 K/TtC to 2.66 K/TtC.}

    abstract = "{The authors quantify the relationship between the location of the intertropical convergence zone (ITCZ) and the atmospheric heat transport across the equator (AHTEQ) in climate models and in observations. The observed zonal mean ITCZ location varies from 5.3°S in the boreal winter to 7.2°N in the boreal summer with an annual mean position of 1.65°N while the AHTEQ varies from 2.1 PW northward in the boreal winter to 2.3 PW southward in the boreal summer with an annual mean of 0.1 PW southward. Seasonal variations in the ITCZ location and AHTEQ are highly anticorrelated in the observations and in a suite of state-of-the-art coupled climate models with regression coefficients of −2.7° and −2.4° PW−1 respectively. It is also found that seasonal variations in ITCZ location and AHTEQ are well correlated in a suite of slab ocean aquaplanet simulations with varying ocean mixed layer depths. However, the regression coefficient between ITCZ location and AHTEQ decreases with decreasing mixed layer depth as a consequence of the asymmetry that develops between the winter and summer Hadley cells as the ITCZ moves farther off the equator.The authors go on to analyze the annual mean change in ITCZ location and AHTEQ in an ensemble of climate perturbation experiments including the response to CO2 doubling, simulations of the Last Glacial Maximum, and simulations of the mid-Holocene. The shift in the annual average ITCZ location is also strongly anticorrelated with the change in annual mean AHTEQ with a regression coefficient of −3.2° PW−1, similar to that found over the seasonal cycle.}",

    abstract = "{The intertropical convergence zone (ITCZ) migrates north–south on seasonal and longer time scales. Previous studies have shown that the zonal-mean ITCZ displacement off the equator is negatively correlated with the energy flux across the equator; when the ITCZ lies in the Northern Hemisphere, energy flows southward across the equator, and vice versa. The hemisphere that exports energy across the equator is the hemisphere with more net energy input, and it is usually the warmer hemisphere. But states with a double ITCZ straddling the equator also occur, for example, seasonally over the eastern Pacific and frequently in climate models. Here it is shown how the ITCZ position is connected to the energy balance near the equator in a broad range of circumstances, including states with single and double ITCZs. Taylor expansion of the variation of the meridional energy flux around the equator leads to the conclusion that for large positive net energy input into the equatorial atmosphere, the ITCZ position depends linearly on the cross-equatorial energy flux. For small positive equatorial net energy input, the dependence of the ITCZ position on the cross-equatorial energy flux weakens to the third root. When the equatorial net energy input or its curvature become negative, a bifurcation to double-ITCZ states occurs. Simulations with an idealized aquaplanet general circulation model (GCM) confirm the quantitative adequacy of these relations. The results provide a framework for assessing and understanding causes of common climate model biases and for interpreting tropical precipitation changes, such as those evident in records of climates of the past.}",

abstract = "Weather variability poses numerous risks to agricultural communities, yet farmers may be able to reduce some of these risks by adapting their cropping practices to better suit changes in weather. However, not all farmers respond to weather variability in the same way. To better identify the causes and consequences of this heterogeneous decision-making, we develop a framework that identifies (1) which socio-economic and biophysical factors are associated with heterogeneous cropping decisions in response to weather variability and (2) which cropping strategies are the most adaptive, considering economic outcomes (e.g., yields and profits). This framework aims to understand how, why, and how effectively farmers adapt to current weather variability; these findings, in turn, may contribute to a more mechanistic and predictive understanding of individual-level adaptation to future climate variability and change. To illustrate this framework, we assessed how 779 farmers responded to delayed monsoon onset in fifteen villages in Gujarat, India during the 2011 growing season, when the monsoon onset was delayed by three weeks. We found that farmers adopted a variety of strategies to cope with delayed monsoon onset, including increasing irrigation use, switching to more drought-tolerant crops, and/or delaying sowing. We found that farmers’ access to and choice of strategies varied with their assets, irrigation access, perceptions of weather, and risk aversion. Richer farmers with more irrigation access used high levels of irrigation, and this strategy was associated with the highest yields in our survey sample. Poorer farmers with less secure access to irrigation were more likely to push back planting dates or switch crop type, and economic data suggest that these strategies were beneficial for those who did not have secure access to irrigation. Interestingly, after controlling for assets and irrigation access, we found that cognitive factors, such as beliefs that the monsoon onset date had changed over the last 20 years or risk aversion, were associated with increased adaptation. Our framework illustrates the importance of considering the complexity and heterogeneity of individual decision-making when conducting climate impact assessments or when developing policies to enhance the adaptive capacity of local communities to future climate variability and change."

abstract = "Inappropriate sowing date constitutes a major reason for crop failure and low yields in the African Sahel region. Deriving from experience in Sudan, this study endeavors to: (1) identify the drivers of farmers’ choice of sowing date for rainfed agriculture, (2) suggest a best-suited guide for farmers in their decision making concerning sowing dates and (3) recommend integrated coping strategies that consider technical and socioeconomic dimensions and regional scales. In this study, sorghum is considered as a strategic crop for food security in the country. The result of data processing based on two climatic methods over the period 1971–2010 has determined the onset of rainfall between the last week of June and the first week of July. An early but safe sowing date in terms of less subsequent dry spells is 08 July. Accordingly, the probability for the establishment of the rainy season is high and the probability of occurrence of following dry spells is lowest. However, this date appears to be earlier than the sowing date commonly practiced by farmers which is usually in the end of July, but sometimes even in the beginning of August. The field survey analysis highlights several non-climatic factors that have significant influence on sorghum cultivation in general and sowing date definition specifically. These include limited agricultural extension service, weeds, basic machinery and low input of fertilizers, herbicides and pesticides. Weed presence and slow and long soil preparation procedures often cause farmers to delay sowing operations, consequently leading to yield reduction. Current coping strategies can serve as a base to advance long-term agricultural policies that guarantee sufficient institutional support and create an enabling environment for knowledge transfer and technical solutions. The results of this research constitute part of an integrated long-term adaptation strategy that has to be developed to improve agricultural activities under climate risk."

abstract = {Abstract This article presents a review of the scientific literature on detection, sources of variability, and predictability of the timing of monsoons. The timing of monsoons is characterized by the beginning (commonly referred to as onset) and end (commonly referred to as demise, cessation, retreat, or withdrawal) dates of the summer monsoons. The main methods used to detect the timing of monsoons are divided into two categories: local-scale methods and regional to large-scale methods. The sources of variability of the timing of monsoons are also separated into two categories: local-scale and large-scale sources. Finally, the article presents a summary of the literature on the predictability of the timing of monsoons using both dynamical and statistical approaches. We show that all methods are parameterized in some way. A comparison between two different methods shows that while there might be large differences in the definition of onset and demise dates at the local level, spatial aggregation usually reduces the noise and enhances the regional monsoonal signal, which may be predictable.},

abstract = {Using daily precipitation data from a network of weather stations across mainland Thailand, we apply a two-phase linear regression model to objectively determine the onset, withdrawal, and length of the summer monsoon season for the years 1951–2005. Our onset metric compares favorably with an independent determination of onset. Both onset and withdrawal are associated with expected wind and geopotential height anomalies in the lower atmosphere. Comparisons between stations show no coherent spatial variability in either onset or withdrawal, and trends at each station are small and statistically insignificant at the p < 0.05 level. When averaged across all stations, onset, withdrawal, and season length all show significant correlations with sea surface temperatures (SST) in the Indian ocean, tropical Pacific, and in the North Pacific regions with relatively well understood connections to monsoon variability. Additionally, there are also significant correlations with SSTs in the South Atlantic and North Atlantic, teleconnections that have been previously suggested but remain controversial. Compared to other methods for deriving the onset and withdrawal of the monsoon, our method provides one of the most objective techniques available using data readily available from most meteorological stations.},

abstract = {Abstract A new method to determine monsoon onset and retreat timings using wavelet transform methodology applied to precipitation time-series at the pentad scale is described. The principal advantage of this method is its portability, since it can be easily adapted for any region and dataset. The application of the method is illustrated for the North American Monsoon and the Indian Monsoon using four different precipitation datasets and climate model output. The method is shown to be robust across all the datasets and both monsoon regions. The mean onset and retreat dates agree well with previous methods. Spatial distributions of the precipitation and circulation anomalies identified around the onset and retreat dates are also consistent with previous work and illustrate that this method may be used at the grid-box scale, not just over large area-averaged regions. The method is also used to characterize the strength and timing of the Midsummer drought (MSD) in southern Mexico and Central America. A two peak structure is found to be a robust structure in only in 33\% of the years, with other years showing only one peak or no signs of a bimodal distribution. The two-peak structure analysed at the grid-box scale is shown to be a significant signal in several regions of Central America and southern Mexico. The methodology is also applied to climate model output from the Met Office Hadley Centre UKESM1 and HadGEM3 CMIP6 experiments. The modelled onset and retreat dates agree well with observations in the North American Monsoon but not in the Indian Monsoon. The start and end of the modelled MSD in southern Mexico and Central America is delayed by one pentad and has a stronger bimodal signal than observed.},

	journal = {Environmental Research Letters},
	abstract = {The Indian summer monsoon rainfall (ISMR) contributes nearly 80% of the annual rainfall over India and has a significant influence on the country’s gross domestic product through the agricultural sector. Onset of the ISMR displays substantial interannual variability and controls the crop calendar and hence the agricultural output. This variability is traditionally linked to sea surface temperature (SST) anomalies over the tropical Pacific Ocean. The tropical Pacific SST underwent a regime shift during 1976/77. We report a prominent delay in the Indian summer monsoon (ISM) onset following the regime shift. The onset dates are computed with the Hydrologic Onset and Withdrawal Index, based on vertically integrated moisture transport over the Arabian Sea (AS). The shift in onset is found to be due to the change in moisture availability over the AS. A delay in the development of easterly vertical shear reduces northward-propagating intraseasonal variability during May–June, limiting the moisture supply from the equatorial Indian Ocean (IO) to the AS. This, along with enhanced precipitation over the IO during the pre-monsoon, drives a reduction in moisture availability over the AS region from pre- to post-1976/77, delaying the ISM onset in recent decades. Our findings highlight the need for the re-assessment of the crop calendar in India, which is now based on the mean onset date computed from long-term data, without considering the regime shift or trends in onset.}

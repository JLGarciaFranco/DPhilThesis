Variability in the characteristics of the ITCZ can affect relatively remote regions through impacts in the tropical convective heating, a modulation of the wave-train propagation and of the strength and location of mass-flux descent \citep {neelin2005,neelin2007moist,cai2019pantropical}.}}{11}{section*.14}%

However, \cite {boos2021} provides an alternative hypothesis for the role of the SMO in the organization of the monsoon in southwestern North America.

In short, the SACZ and the SALLJ are prominent features of the mean SAMS but their variability also modulates the SAMS precipitation on multiple temporal timescales \citep [e.g.][]{marengo2012,junquas2012summer,perez2021}. }}{18}{section*.22}%

Evidence shows that the Andes cordillera deflects the low-level wind flow from the equatorial Atlantic southward mechanically forcing the SALLJ \citep {campetella2002influence,insel2010influence} and thereby contributing to the tropical-to-subtropical moisture transport. The Andes cordillera also blocks the westerly winds from the Pacific Ocean which would ventilate low-level moisture in South America \citep {insel2010influence} and the existence of the cordillera is key to the formation and location of the SACZ \citep {junquas2016influence}. }}{18}{section*.23}%
\contentsline {added}{Added: \truncate {\Changestruncatewidth }{The global monsoon theories discussed in the previous section struggle to accurately depict several aspects of the NAMS and the SAMS.

The role of orography and soil-atmosphere interactions may be playing a big part in both the SMO and the Amazon to decouple the sub-cloud MSE and the free troposphere \citep [see e.g.][]{boos2021}. One alternative hypothesis is that ventilation of low moist entropy air from the midlatitudes is responsible for this decoupling of the boundary layer and the free troposphere in the American monsoons \citep {boos2015review}. Similarly, the meridional circulations associated with these monsoons do not fit the framework of \cite {bordoni2008monsoons}, which suggests an alignment of the maximum ascent with the maximum surface MSE, which is not observed in either monsoon of the AMS.

\contentsline {added}{Added: \truncate {\Changestruncatewidth }{ENSO teleconnections impact the AMS both through the tropical and the extratropical pathways \citep {marengo2012,sulca2018,cai2020}. The extratropical pathway refers to these anomalous Rossby wave-trains caused by tropical convective heating that propagate from the equatorial Pacific to the extratropical Pacific and Atlantic affecting both northern and southern hemispheres \citep {hoskins1981steady,jimenez2018tropospheric,fereday2020}. The influence of ENSO on the subtropical jets, or the storm track, can impact boreal winter climate in subtropical North and South America \citep {marengo2012,bayr2019}. }}{26}{section*.32}%
\contentsline {added}{Added: \truncate {\Changestruncatewidth }{ These wave-driven anomalies cause differences in the regional sea-level pressure systems and the location of the storm track. For example, ENSO induces changes to the Aleutian Low pressure system and similar SLP anomalies of opposite sign over the North American continent, in a teleconnection pattern that is more commonly referred to as the Pacific-North American (PNA) \citep {deser2010sea,bayr2019,jimenezesteve2020}. A similar teleconnection is observed as wave trains travelling from the South Pacific to the South Atlantic, i.e., the Pacific-South American (PSA) pattern \citep {mo2001pacific,vera2009,cai2020}. Specifically, El Ni√±o events induce a positive phase of the PNA pattern during boreal winter which leads to enhanced precipitation and colder conditions over northern Mexico due to the increased frequency of the intrusion of cold mid-latitude disturbances \citep {magana2003}. }}{26}{section*.33}%
\contentsline {added}{Added: \truncate {\Changestruncatewidth }{The tropical pathway involves the changes to the location and strength of the Walker circulation explained above, in which anomalous descending and ascending anomalies are found in the Amazon region for El Ni√±o and La Ni√±a years, respectively. Another relevant pathway is the impact of ENSO associated with the PNA pattern, which induces changes to the easterly trade winds in the subtropical Atlantic and subsequent impacts to the ITCZ \citep {hastenrath2006,fereday2020}. For instance, El Ni√±o teleconnections throught the PNA pattern lead to a warming of the northern equatorial Atlantic SSTs and induce a delay in the seasonal migration southwards of the Atlantic ITCZ causing a drying of the northern South America \citep {hastenrath2006,cai2020}. The influence of the northern tropical Atlantic and the delay in the southward shift of the Atlantic ITCZ has been shown to influence not only northeastern Brazil rainfall but also extreme events throughout the SAMS \citep {yoon2010atlantic,andreoli2012seasonal,jimenez2021}. }}{27}{section*.34}%
\contentsline {added}{Added: \truncate {\Changestruncatewidth }{ Current research on ENSO teleconnections to South America focuses on the observed non-linearity and non-symmetry of the impacts, which has mainly been attributed to ENSO diversity \citep {tedeschi2015,cai2020,jimenez2021}. ENSO diversity refers to the observed feature that the maximum SST anomaly does not always appear in the same region of the Pacific Ocean \citep {ashok2009,dommenget2013}. These differences in the SST patterns are referred to as ENSO \textit {flavours} which can be broadly summarized as two flavours for each phase. The flavours are defined based on the location of the SST anomaly so the most common division is into Central and Eastern Pacific events. In observations, each type of event is usually also associated with the strength of the event \citep {dommenget2013}, with eastern Pacific events being usually stronger than Central Pacific events. }}{27}{section*.35}%

More generally, whether the QBO has a considerable effect on deep convection in general is debated as several plausible mechanisms exist in the literature \citep [see e.g.][]{nie2015} such as the effect of wind shear, the tropopause height, the cold-point temperature, static stability and/or feedbacks with very high cirrus and cumulunimbus clouds or the tropical circulation. }}{34}{section*.47}%

\contentsline {added}{Added: \truncate {\Changestruncatewidth }{The MSE budget analysis is able to show what terms vary more coherently with the timing of the MSD, as well as what terms explain better the variability of the strength of the MSD. First, this section shows that vertical advection terms show a bimodal seasonal cycle, which points to the strong relationship between $\omega $ and precipitation. However, the surface $h$ remains relatively constant throughout the rainy season, in contrast to the suggestions by \cite {karnauskas2013}. The patterns of anomalous vertical and horizontal transport of $h$ also show strong variations synchronous to the MSD stages, suggesting that precipitation follows closely variations in $h$. }}{159}{section*.159}%

This evidence (Fig. \ref {fig:thermo_barplotnm}) suggests that LW heating and CRE, and moisture transport may be more important than the variations in surface fluxes or the shortwave heating because their variations are more strongly linked to the MSD variations of precipitation. The horizontal advection fluctuations partially support the mechanism that links the moisture transport from the CLLJ to the precipitation in the MSD, however, further work is needed to link the CLLJ to the horizontal advection term. }}{159}{section*.160}%

\contentsline {added}{Added: \truncate {\Changestruncatewidth }{The leading hypothesis to explain an impact from the QBO on tropical deep convection suggests that changes to the UTLS static stability, caused by the QBO residual circulation, modifies the strength of convection \citep {collimore2003,liess2012,nie2015}. However, most of the existing climate models underestimate the amplitude of the QBO in the lowermost stratosphere (Figure \ref {fig:qboamplitude}) and by consequence the variability of the UTLS static stability associated with the QBO is lower in state-of-the-art GCMs \citep {schenzinger2017,richter2020,bushell2020}. For example, the observed relationships between the QBO and the MJO have not been found in GCMs \citep {lee2018,kim2020} and one reason for these results may be the underestimation of the UTLS temperature variability associated with the QBO in current GCMs.}}{166}{section*.165}%
\contentsline {added}{Added: \truncate {\Changestruncatewidth }{In short, there is a lack of robust evidence for QBO surface impacts in the tropics as QBO-related anomalies in observations may be the result of chance or the upward effect of tropical convection on the characteristics of the QBO.

Moreover, nudging has been succesfully applied to this model in previous studies \citep {telford2008description,gray2020}. For these reasons, the UM is ideal to investigate whether there are any surface impacts in the tropics associated with the QBO and what mechanisms may be at play in the observed stratospheric-tropospheric coupling.}}{167}{section*.166}%

The tapering refers to a linear interpolation between the maximum $G$ and zero nudging ($G=0$).

Shifts to the Atlantic ITCZ in the model are not seen in observations, and are likely influenced by model biases, however, this is one of the first pieces of evidence of a QBO-ITCZ relationship in a GCM.

\contentsline {added}{Added: \truncate {\Changestruncatewidth }{In contrast, a relatively well-known aspect of tropical climate is the El Ni√±o-Southern Oscillation (ENSO), which is a coupled-ocean atmosphere phenomena in the Pacific Ocean that produces long-distance impacts throughout the planet \citep {mcphaden2006}, prominently influencing interannual variability in the AMS regions \citep {magana2003,vera2006,marengo2014climate}. Progress has been made in understanding the impacts and pathways of ENSO to South America \citep {marengo2012,cai2020}, and current research has found that diversity in ENSO events causes different impacts to South America \citep {hill2009south,tedeschi2015}. A currently active topic of research aims to understand how impacts to the AMS depend on the interaction between ENSO and its teleconnections and other aspects of climate variability \citep {cai2019pantropical,cai2020,jimenez2021}.}}{3}{section*.8}%
\contentsline {added}{Added: \truncate {\Changestruncatewidth }{For instance, a growing number of studies have suggested a link between the stratosphere and the tropical troposphere, called stratospheric-tropospheric coupling \citep {haynes2021influence}. This coupling is suggested to include tropospheric features such as ENSO and other modes of tropical variability \citep {hitchman2021observational,martin2021nature}. There is no full description of the causes for these observed relationships yet, but if the stratosphere is found to be a relevant factor to modulate aspects of tropical convection, such as ENSO impacts, there would be an opportunity to better predict tropospheric variability because the equatorial stratosphere is generally predictable at longer time-scales than the troposphere.

The first result chapter also shows suggestive evidence that the stratosphere may play a role in ENSO impacts to South America, which leads to Chapter \ref {ch:7-qbo} which investigates whether there is any coupling between the stratosphere and the troposphere within the GCM. }}{4}{section*.10}%

\contentsline {added}{Added: \truncate {\Changestruncatewidth }{Another prominent feature of the tropical climate is the Intertropical Convergence Zone (ITCZ), which is a coherent band of convective clouds and precipitation that migrates meridionally with the seasons, characterized by strong convergent flow at low levels and a strong divergent flow at upper levels which leads to a large positive vertical mass flux and ascent \citep {schneider2014,byrne2016}. The ITCZ is collocated with the position of ascending branch of the Hadley cell \citep {donohoe2013,hartmann2015}. The strength of convection in the ITCZ is such that the largest precipitation rates in the tropics are typically found in the ITCZ.}}{10}{section*.13}%
\contentsline {added}{Added: \truncate {\Changestruncatewidth }{Over regional scales, the seasonal migration of the ITCZ follows closely the seasonal cycle of SSTs, which depends on the solar insolation and the coupling between SST gradients, cloud radiative heating and the low-level easterly flow \citep [see e.g.][]{richter2014equatorial,siongco2015,oueslati2015,harrop2016}. Variability in the characteristics of the ITCZ can affect relatively remote regions through impacts in the tropical convective heating, a modulation of the wave-train propagation and by modifying the strength and location of descending regions \citep {neelin2005,neelin2007moist,cai2019pantropical}.}}{10}{section*.14}%

\contentsline {added}{Added: \truncate {\Changestruncatewidth }{Early studies suggest that the role of the SMO is to channel moisture from the East Pacific and Gulf of California \citep {seastrand2015} or in a mountain-sea breeze mechanism operating with the diurnal cycle of the low-level winds \citep {nesbitt2008diurnal}. However, \cite {boos2021} provide an alternative hypothesis for the role of the SMO in the organization of the monsoon in southwestern North America. Their results suggest that the role of the SMO is to deflect the subtropical jet and produce an eastward upward flow that organizes convection in a confined region with relative high surface moist static energy.}}{17}{section*.19}%
\contentsline {added}{Added: \truncate {\Changestruncatewidth }{The South American Low-Level Jet (SALLJ) and the South Atlantic Convergence Zone (SACZ) are two primary climatic features of the SAMS \citep {vera2006,marengo2012,jones2019recent}. The SACZ is observed as a nortwest-southeast oriented band of convection \citep {carvalho2004,nobre2012coupled,jorgetti2014,zilli2019} that is more frequently active during austral summer in association with the onset of the SAMS \citep {marengo2012,perez2021}. }}{17}{section*.20}%

Variability of the SACZ diagnosed as shifts to the position and strength of the band of convection are intertwined with the continental-scale moisture transport and precipitation in south eastern Brazil and central South America \citep {mo2001pacific,jorgetti2014,perez2021}.}}{18}{section*.21}%
\contentsline {added}{Added: \truncate {\Changestruncatewidth }{The low-level wind circulation imports moisture from the Atlantic Ocean. Once the flow has crossed through the Amazon, the low-level winds are steered by the Andes cordillera into the SALLJ \citep {geen2019,jones2019recent}. The variability of the SALLJ can modulate active and break phases of the monsoon as well as active days of the SACZ, through the modulation of the moisture transport across the continent \citep [e.g.][]{liebmann2011,grimm2011,jones2019recent}. In short, the SACZ and the SALLJ are prominent features of the mean SAMS but their variability also modulates the SAMS precipitation on multiple temporal timescales \citep [e.g.][]{marengo2012,junquas2012summer,perez2021}. }}{18}{section*.22}%
\contentsline {added}{Added: \truncate {\Changestruncatewidth }{ South American orography, which features the Andes cordillera, has long been investigated for its role in the dynamics of the SAMS \citep [e.g.][]{rodwell2001subtropical,campetella2002influence,insel2010influence, saurral2015links,junquas2016influence}. Evidence shows that the Andes cordillera deflects the low-level wind flow from the equatorial Atlantic southward mechanically forcing the SALLJ \citep {campetella2002influence,insel2010influence} and thereby contributing to the tropical-to-subtropical moisture transport. The Andes cordillera also blocks the westerly winds from the Pacific Ocean which would ventilate low-level moisture in South America \citep {insel2010influence} and the existence of the cordillera is key to the formation and location of the SACZ \citep {junquas2016influence}. }}{18}{section*.23}%
\contentsline {added}{Added: \truncate {\Changestruncatewidth }{The global monsoon theories discussed in the previous section struggle to accurately depict several aspects of the NAMS and the SAMS. For example, the North and South American Monsoons depart from CQE, as precipitation does not follow the maxima in sub-cloud equivalent potential temperature \citep {nie2010observational,geen2020}. The role of orography and soil-atmosphere interactions may be playing a big part in both the SMO and the Amazon to decouple the sub-cloud MSE and the free troposphere \citep [see e.g.][]{boos2021}. One alternative hypothesis is that ventilation of low moist entropy air from the midlatitudes is responsible for this decoupling of the boundary layer and the free troposphere in the American monsoons \citep {boos2015review}. Similarly, the meridional circulations associated with these monsoons do not fit the framework of \cite {bordoni2008monsoons}, which suggests an alignment of the maximum ascent with the maximum surface MSE, which is not observed in either monsoon of the AMS. As such, existing monsoon theories either do not fit the observed AMS, or need to be tailored to explain only one of these monsoons. }}{19}{section*.24}%

\contentsline {added}{Added: \truncate {\Changestruncatewidth }{ENSO teleconnections impact the AMS regions through both tropical and extratropical pathways \citep {marengo2012,sulca2018,cai2020}. For example, Figure \ref {fig:enso} shows the impact of ENSO over other tropical regions outside of the Pacific through the Walker circulation, as upper-level wind anomalies induce anomalous vertical motions over West Africa \citep {ropelewski1986,ropelewski1987} or South America \citep {sulca2018}. The extratropical pathway involves anomalous Rossby wave-trains caused by tropical convective heating that propagate from the equatorial Pacific to the extratropical Pacific and Atlantic affecting both northern and southern hemispheres \citep {hoskins1981steady,jimenez2018tropospheric,fereday2020}. These wave-driven anomalies cause differences in the regional sea-level pressure systems and the location of the storm track. }}{25}{section*.32}%
\contentsline {added}{Added: \truncate {\Changestruncatewidth }{ For example, ENSO induces changes to the Aleutian Low pressure system and similar SLP anomalies of opposite sign over the North American continent, in a teleconnection pattern that is more commonly referred to as the Pacific-North American (PNA) and which also influences the underlying SSTs \citep {deser2010sea,lin2015subseasonal,bayr2019,jimenezesteve2020}. A similar teleconnection is observed as wave trains travelling from the South Pacific to the South Atlantic, i.e., the Pacific-South American (PSA) pattern \citep {mo2001pacific,vera2009,cai2020}. Specifically, El Ni√±o events induce a positive phase of the PNA pattern during boreal winter which leads to enhanced precipitation and colder conditions over northern Mexico due to the increased frequency of the intrusion of cold mid-latitude disturbances \citep {magana2003}. }}{26}{section*.33}%
\contentsline {added}{Added: \truncate {\Changestruncatewidth }{The tropical pathway involves the changes to the location and strength of the Walker circulation explained above, in which anomalous descending and ascending anomalies are found in the Amazon region for El Ni√±o and La Ni√±a years, respectively. Another impact in the North Atlantic is indirectly caused by via the modulation of the PNA pattern on the easterly trade winds in the subtropical Atlantic which subsequently impacts the Atlantic ITCZ \citep {hastenrath2006,fereday2020}. For instance, El Ni√±o teleconnections through the PNA pattern lead to a warming of the northern tropical Atlantic SSTs which induce a delay in the seasonal migration southwards of the Atlantic ITCZ causing a drying of northern South America \citep {hastenrath2006,cai2020}. The influence of the northern tropical Atlantic and the delay in the southward shift of the Atlantic ITCZ not only influences rainfall over northeastern Brazil but also modulates extreme events throughout the SAMS \citep {yoon2010atlantic,andreoli2012seasonal,jimenez2021}. }}{26}{section*.34}%
\contentsline {added}{Added: \truncate {\Changestruncatewidth }{ Current research on ENSO teleconnections to South America focuses on the observed non-linearity and asymmetry of the impacts, which has mainly been attributed to ENSO diversity \citep {tedeschi2015,cai2020,jimenez2021}. ENSO diversity refers to the observed feature that the maximum SST anomaly does not always appear in the same region of the Pacific Ocean \citep {ashok2009,dommenget2013}. These differences in the SST patterns are referred to as ENSO \textit {flavours} which can be broadly summarized as two flavours for each phase. The flavours are defined based on the location of the SST anomaly so the most common division is into Central and Eastern Pacific events. In observations, each type of event is usually also associated with the strength of the event \citep {dommenget2013}, with eastern Pacific events being usually stronger than Central Pacific events. }}{27}{section*.35}%
\contentsline {added}{Added: \truncate {\Changestruncatewidth }{ENSO diversity has important implications for global teleconnections; specifically, precipitation impacts and the occurrence of droughts in the SAMS have been linked to non-linear effects associated with the location of the SST anomalies in the Pacific \citep {rodrigues2011,sulca2018,cai2020,jimenez2021}. \cite {cai2020} provides a recent review on the differences in the impacts that Central and Eastern Pacific (CP and EP) events have on South American precipitation and climate features.

More generally, there is no consensus on whether the QBO has a considerable effect on tropical deep convection. Several plausible mechanisms exist in the literature that involve a QBO modulation of wind shear, the tropopause height, the cold-point temperature, static stability and/or feedbacks with very high cirrus and cumulunimbus clouds or the tropical circulation \citep [see e.g][]{martin2021nature} but more research is required to provide any definitive answers. }}{34}{section*.49}%

\contentsline {added}{Added: \truncate {\Changestruncatewidth }{The MSE budget analysis is able to show what terms vary more coherently with the timing of the MSD, as well as what terms explain better the variability of the strength of the MSD. First, this section shows that vertical advection terms show a bimodal seasonal cycle, which points to the strong relationship between $\omega $ and precipitation. However, the surface $h$ remains relatively constant throughout the rainy season, in contrast to the suggestions by \cite {karnauskas2013}. The patterns of anomalous vertical and horizontal transport of $h$ also show strong variations synchronous to the MSD stages, suggesting that precipitation follows closely variations in $h$. }}{160}{section*.167}%

This evidence (Fig. \ref {fig:thermo_barplotnm}) suggests that LW heating and CRE, and moisture transport may be more important than the variations in surface fluxes or the shortwave heating because their variations are more strongly linked to the MSD variations of precipitation. The horizontal advection fluctuations partially support the mechanism that links the moisture transport from the CLLJ to the precipitation in the MSD, however, further work is needed to link the CLLJ to the horizontal advection term. }}{161}{section*.168}%

Variability of the CLLJ and its influence over the regional moisture transport seem to be key for other aspects other than the MSD \citep {duranquesada2017,sierra2021}. For example, evidence that the flow from the Caribbean Sea over the orography of the Mesoamerican region modulates convective activity in tropical cyclones \citep {fu2021central}, as well as the role of the CLLJ in teleconnection mechanisms from the Madden Julian Oscillation (MJO) \citep {martin2011,perdigon2019} highlight the relevance of the low-level jet in the dynamics and precipitation variability. In short, our results agree with recent work \citep {boos2021,fu2021central} that suggests a larger role for mechanical forcing than radiative-thermodynamic effects in modulating precipitation variations in the region.}}{165}{section*.169}%

One example is the tropical route of QBO teleconnections question, in which biases in the simulation of tropical convective features, such as the MJO, and biases in the QBO, complicate the investigation of cause and effect in stratospheric-tropospheric interactions.
